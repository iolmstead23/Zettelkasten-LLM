# Zettelkasten-LLM
Analysis and construction of Zettelkasten sysem using Large Language Models

# Intro
The intention of this project is to explore a Zettelkasten system indexed by markdown files. These markdown files are written using Obsidian as the editor. I recommend saving your vault to a Google Drive and also backing up your vault on local storage as well. These scripts run reports on the overall health of the Zettelkasten system, taking into consideration factors like the overall links-to-nodes ratio, sentiment analysis to understand tone (an important parameter to remember), and other latent quantifiable variables yet to be explored. This is the first level of functionality. The next level of functionality is the chatbot. It would be trained using large language model architecture.

The user would write short essays, which get labeled and indexed. There would be a function that checks reading comprehension and adjusts its speech to better synergize with the user. It's not about how much the user can do; it's about finding out how to provide an experience while never sacrificing control. Software should be intuitive.

Overall, the goal is to reduce the loss metric by trying to increase the number of nodes while also constantly validating information with the user. There has to be a health metric that can be calculated no matter the age of the user. It is intended to brain-hack the user into building a hyper brain that exists with the user from early development to elder years. This would help those with concussions have backup memories they can fall back on. There is potential for this technology to be a jackpot for hackers trying to steal someone's identity. There must be absolute precision when using this technology. If used for ill intentions, someone's entire existence is at stake.

The intended target audience would be academic purposes exclusively. Ethics are most important.

# Instructions

The scripts folder contain a list of python scripts that are intended to run and save different reports. Save your markdown files in the Zettelkasten folder and run whichever scripts necessary. This will save a text file of the report in the output folder.
