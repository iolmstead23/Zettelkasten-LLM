### IT Governance
IT governance is the system of processes that ensures the effective and efficient use of IT to enable an organization to achieve its business goals and to add value to key stakeholders in an organization. This governance provides the company's IT function with strategic management, realizations of benefits to the organization, risk optimization, and resource optimization. In addition, it supports the company's compliance with regulations and supports initiatives for competitive advantages, the company's growth and innovation, an increase of assets, and the reduction of risks.

As an organizational system, an IT department should have a clearly defined vision, mission, and set of core values that define its own strategic, tactical, and operational goals for supporting the organization. The vision states what the department would like to achieve, the mission states how they will achieve the vision, and the core values state expected behaviors. The vision, mission, and objectives of the IT department should closely align with the vision, mission, and objectives of the organization.
### IT Job Functions

Some organizations use the outsourcing model, keeping a core IT department to manage the operations and work with one or more third-party service providers. The third-party service providers do the needed technical work. IT employees manage the work of third parties, ensuring it is done according to specifications and requirements and acting as business analysts and project managers.

Several job functions are typical in an IT department, whether employed internally or externally contracted:

- _**Network administrators**_ set up, maintain, and monitor the hardware and software that support the networking components of the computer systems.
- _**Systems administrators**_ set up, maintain, and monitor devices that support business operations. These devices include anything from projectors and smartboards in a training room to the devices in the server room.
- _**Web administrators**_ control the outward-facing content on an organization’s website and intranets and ensure that the sites function and integrate with back-end systems, such as supporting databases.
- _**Database administrators**_ configure and troubleshoot an organization’s data repositories.
- _**Cybersecurity analysts**_ monitor the behaviors of the system components for anomalies and malicious attacks. They also put measures in place to deter, detect, and mitigate internal and external threats.
- _**Technical support specialists**_ provide end-user training and help users resolve issues accessing resources and systems.

Larger IT departments may include special-purpose teams within the IT departments. For example, an organization might have a team of cloud engineers dedicated to supporting cloud applications and virtual storage or a reporting team that maintains systems that generate reports. Typically, system administrators and network administrators in large organizations also have dedicated responsibilities. Systems administrators focus on things like user and device support. Network administrators focus on things like network device and server management. In small to medium-sized organizations, IT roles often blend responsibilities. In small organizations, it is common for the network and system administrator roles to be performed by a single person.

In addition to technical roles, organizations use managerial and leadership oversight roles in IT that may include functional managers, chief information officers (CIO), and chief information security officers (CISO). In addition, general managerial and leadership functions also provide direction to the IT function.
### Organizational Models for the IT Function

Outsourcing uses the resources and skills of a developed workforce from an external organization. Hiring an organization that specializes in particular services is beneficial, as companies cannot always justify employing specialists with narrow skill sets. Outsourcing can improve efficiency and productivity, while also helping an organization save money. Third-party organizations are experienced in areas in which the current staff would otherwise need additional lead time for training. Also, outsourcing allows internal staff to be more productive in core business functions as the contracted organization focuses on auxiliary tasks. When an organization does decide to outsource a task or project, the first step should always be to consult with the potential third-party provider, often referred to as a vendor, and request a demonstration (demo) of the proposed solution.

Multiple outsourcing modalities include offshoring, outsourcing outside country lines; project outsourcing, where project management is outsourced; and nearshoring, offshoring to countries in a closer time zone or with an economic structure close to that of the home country.

_**Insourcing**_ assigns a project to employees within the organization. Insourcing generally requires the development of new operations and processes, making it an expensive option.

An organization's control over operations and decisions differs depending on whether the organization is outsourcing or insourcing.

Consider the advantages and disadvantages of the three outsourcing models described above. Have you ever worked for an organization that outsourced any of its IT functions? If so, think about how effective that model was.
