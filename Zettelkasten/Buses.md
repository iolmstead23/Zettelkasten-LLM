**Buses** or **bus lines** are the wires that serve as electrical roadways, transmitting information between the CPU and other components. The size of the bus is related to the amount of data that can be transmitted at once. Instructions are sent through the bus lines to the CPU and include how to process the data and which component to use. These instructions are split and sent through three different types of buses: address buses, data buses, and control buses.
